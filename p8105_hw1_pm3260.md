# Problem 1

Installed palmerpenguins in the console.

``` r
# Loading the penguins data set:
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

### Description of penguins data set.

The data set contains 344 rows and 8 columns.

The penguin data set contains these variables: species, island,
bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex,
year.

The years of observation are 2007-2009. and the species include: Adelie,
Gentoo, Chinstrap.

Islands include: Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream.

There are 168 males and 165 females

The mean bill length is 43.9219298, the mean bill depth is 17.1511696,
and the mean flipper length is 200.9152047.

The body mass (in grams), ranging from 2700 to 6300 grams.

### Scatterplot of Flipper Length vs Bill Length

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Flipper Length vs Bill Length",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Flipper Length (mm)")
```
